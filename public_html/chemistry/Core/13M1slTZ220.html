<p class="p1">Which statement describes and explains the conditions that favour the formation of hydrogen iodide?</p>
<p class="p1">A.     Increased temperature as the forward reaction is exothermic, and increased pressure as there are two gaseous reactants and only one gaseous product</p>
<p class="p1">B.     Increased temperature as the forward reaction is endothermic, and pressure has no effect as there are equal amounts, in mol, of gaseous reactants and products</p>
<p class="p1">C.     Decreased temperature as the forward reaction is exothermic, and decreased pressure as there are two moles of gaseous product but only one mole of each gaseous reactant</p>
<p class="p1">D.     Decreased temperature as the forward reaction is exothermic, and pressure has no effect as there are equal amounts, in mol, of gaseous reactants and products</p>
