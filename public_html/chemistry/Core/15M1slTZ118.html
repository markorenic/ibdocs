<p>Nitrogen gas reacts with hydrogen gas according to the following equation.</p>
<p>\[{{\text{N}}_{\text{2}}}{\text{(g)}} + {\text{3}}{{\text{H}}_{\text{2}}}{\text{(g)}} \rightleftharpoons {\text{2N}}{{\text{H}}_{\text{3}}}{\text{(g)}}\;\;\;\;\;\Delta H =  - 92{\text{ kJ}}\]</p>
<p>Why is the rate of reaction slow at room temperature?</p>
<p>A.     The activation energy of the forward reaction is high.</p>
<p>B.     The activation energy of the forward reaction is low.</p>
<p>C.     The equilibrium constant is very small.</p>
<p>D.     The rate of the reverse reaction is greater than the rate of the forward reaction.</p>
