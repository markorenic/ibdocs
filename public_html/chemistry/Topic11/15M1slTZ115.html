<p class="p1">The heat change in a neutralization reaction can be determined by mixing equal volumes of HCl(aq) and NaOH(aq) of the same concentration in a glass beaker. The maximum temperature change is recorded using an alcohol thermometer.</p>
<p class="p1">What is the biggest source of error in this experiment?</p>
<p class="p1">A.     Heat absorbed by the glass thermometer</p>
<p class="p1">B.     Random error in the thermometer reading</p>
<p class="p1">C.     Heat loss to the surroundings</p>
<p class="p1">D.     Systematic error in measuring the volumes of HCl(aq) and NaOH(aq) using burettes</p>
