<p>What is always correct about the molecular ion, M<sup>+</sup>, in a mass spectrum of a compound?</p>
<p>A. The M<sup>+</sup> ion peak has the smallest <em>m/z </em>ratio in the mass spectrum.</p>
<p>B. The <em>m/z </em>ratio of the M<sup>+</sup> ion peak gives the relative molecular mass of the molecule.</p>
<p>C. The M<sup>+</sup> ion is the most stable fragment formed during electron bombardment.</p>
