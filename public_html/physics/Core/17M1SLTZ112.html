<p>A fixed mass of an ideal gas in a closed container with a movable piston initially occupies a volume <em>V</em>. The position of the piston is changed, so that the mean kinetic energy of the particles in the gas is doubled and the pressure remains constant.</p>
<p>What is the new volume of the gas?</p>
<p>A.  \(\frac{V}{4}\)</p>
<p>B.  \(\frac{V}{2}\)</p>
<p>C.  2<em>V</em></p>
<p>D.  4<em>V</em></p>
