<p>Monochromatic electromagnetic radiation is incident on a metal surface. The kinetic energy of the electrons released from the metal</p>
<p>A. is constant because the photons have a constant energy.</p>
<p>B. is constant because the metal has a constant work function.</p>
<p>C. varies because the electrons are not equally bound to the metal lattice.</p>
<p>D. varies because the work function of the metal is different for different electrons.</p>
