<p>In a wind generator, the kinetic energy of the wind cannot be completely converted into mechanical kinetic energy. This is because</p>
<p>A. momentum is not conserved in the collisions between air molecules and the blades.</p>
<p>B. the density of the air depends on the temperature of the air.</p>
<p>C. the air molecules cannot be brought completely to rest in collisions with the blades.</p>
<p>D. the wind speed does not remain constant.</p>
