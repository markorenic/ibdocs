<p>A mass at the end of a vertical spring and a simple pendulum perform oscillations on Earth that are simple harmonic with time period <em>T</em>. Both the pendulum and the mass-spring system are taken to the Moon. The acceleration of free fall on the Moon is smaller than that on Earth. What is correct about the time periods of the pendulum and the mass-spring system on the Moon?</p>
